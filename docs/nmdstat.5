NMDSTAT(5) - NonRAID Driver Status Interface

NAME
nmdstat - NonRAID driver status interface

SYNOPSIS
/proc/nmdstat

DESCRIPTION
The /proc/nmdstat file provides detailed status information for the NonRAID 
(Multiple Devices) driver. This interface exposes array configuration, disk 
states, recovery operations, and performance statistics in a structured text 
format.

FORMAT
The output consists of key-value pairs in the format:
    key=value

Fields are organized into sections: superblock information (sb*), array 
metadata (md*), and per-disk information (disk*/rdev*).

sbVersion
    Superblock format version (major.minor.patch)

sbCreated
    Unix timestamp when array was created

sbUpdated
    Unix timestamp of last superblock update

sbEvents
    Superblock update counter

sbState
    Superblock state flags (0=clean, others indicate unclean shutdown)

ARRAY STATES

STARTED

DISABLE_DISK
    Disk disable operation needed

SWAP_DSBL

ERROR:*
    Error states indicating configuration problems:
    - ERROR:INVALID_EXPANSION

    - ERROR:NEW_DISK_TOO_SMALL
    - ERROR:NO_DATA_DISKS

DISK STATUSES

DISK_OK
    Disk present, correct, and valid

DISK_NP
    No disk present, no disk configured

DISK_NP_MISSING
    Enabled disk is missing

DISK_INVALID
    Disk present but not valid (needs reconstruction)

DISK_WRONG
    Wrong disk present in slot

DISK_DSBL
    Disabled, old disk still present

DISK_NP_DSBL
    Disabled, no disk present

DISK_DSBL_NEW
    Disabled, new disk present

DISK_NEW
    New disk detected

DISK STATE FLAGS
Disk state is represented as a bitmask:

Bit 0 (VALID)
    Disk contains valid data

Bit 1 (ENABLED)
    Disk is enabled for array operations

Bit 2 (ACTIVE)
    Disk is active in array configuration

MONITORING GUIDANCE

Critical Fields to Monitor

mdState
    Should be "STARTED" for normal operation. Error states require attention.

sbState
    Should be 1 (clean). Value 0 indicates unclean shutdown.

mdNumMissing, mdNumWrong, mdNumInvalid
    Non-zero values indicate degraded array requiring attention.

rdevNumErrors.N
    Increasing error counts indicate failing drives.

mdResyncAction, mdResyncPos
    Monitor recovery progress and detect stalled operations.

Recovery Operations
Recovery operations are indicated by:

mdResync > 0
    Recovery is active

mdResyncAction
    Describes operation type: "check", "recon", "clear"

Progress calculation
    (mdResyncPos / mdResyncSize) * 100 = percentage complete

Rate calculation
    mdResyncDb / mdResyncDt = blocks per second

Error Conditions

Array not starting
    Check for ERROR states in mdState

Degraded array
    Monitor mdNumMissing + mdNumInvalid â‰¤ 2 for dual-parity protection

Drive failures
    Watch for increasing rdevNumErrors and DISK_INVALID status

Sync errors
    Monitor sbSyncErrs for data integrity issues

    mdResyncPos=500000

    mdNumMissing=1
    mdNumInvalid=0
    rdevStatus.5=DISK_NP_MISSING

SPECIAL DISK SLOTS

Slot 0 (P-parity)
    Primary parity disk

Slot 29 (Q-parity)
    Secondary parity disk (dual-parity arrays)

Slots 1-28
    Data disk slots

PERFORMANCE MONITORING

I/O Statistics
Monitor rdevReads.N and rdevWrites.N to track disk usage patterns.

Error Tracking
Increasing rdevNumErrors.N values indicate potential disk problems.

Recovery Performance
Use mdResyncDb/mdResyncDt to calculate recovery speed in blocks per second.

FILES

/proc/nmdstat
    Read-only status interface

/proc/nmdcmd
    Write-only command interface

NOTES
The NonRAID driver is specifically designed for unRAID's single/dual-parity
array architecture and differs significantly from standard Linux MD-RAID.

All disk sizes are reported in 1024-byte blocks unless otherwise specified.
Sector counts are in 512-byte sectors.

Recovery operations can be paused and resumed. A paused recovery will show
mdResync=0 but mdResyncPos will retain the last position.

The driver supports up to 30 disks total: 28 data disks plus 2 parity disks.
